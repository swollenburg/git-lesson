This lesson covers the basics of using git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp.

To make a commit (or "Version" or "checkpoint") of you files,
follow this procedure:

1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep.
2. When you have your changeds, tell git you are ready to create a commit by adding giles to the staging area using "git add filename"
3. Create a checkpoint ("commit") using 'git commit -m "message about what you did"'
